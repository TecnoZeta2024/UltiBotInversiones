- [ ] Memory usage reasonable for expected data volumes
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits
- [ ] Potential bottlenecks identified and documented

## Documentation & Maintenance

### Internal Documentation
- [ ] Code-level documentation updated (`docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/data-models.md`)
- [ ] API documentation automatically generated correctly
- [ ] New patterns or utilities documented for team knowledge
- [ ] Configuration changes documented

### User-Facing Changes
- [ ] API changes documented in `docs/api-reference.md` (if applicable)
- [ ] Breaking changes clearly marked and communicated
- [ ] Migration guide provided for significant changes (if needed)

### Deployment & Configuration
- [ ] Environment variables documented if new ones added
- [ ] Configuration changes backwards compatible or upgrade path provided
- [ ] Database migrations can be run safely
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs or development-specific configurations

## Final Verification

### Code Review
- [ ] Code reviewed by another team member or self-review completed
- [ ] All review feedback addressed
- [ ] No debug code or temporary modifications left in codebase

- [ ] Strategy activation/deactivation for both paper and real modes works
- [ ] Parameter validation works for all strategy types (Scalping, Day Trading, Arbitrage)
- [ ] Database persistence correctly handles JSONB fields for strategy parameters
- [ ] API endpoints handle all specified request/response scenarios

### Technical Implementation Validation
